# 1. Make app work for large numbers of receipts 

On github at https://github.com/jmcconochie/receipt-manager-app

# buildrun_docker.sh does what it says
http://192.168.86.10:5000


# This is useful to debug
docker exec -it receipt_scanner tail -f /var/log/flask_app.err.log

# This is where to see activity and add money for using the chatgpt API
